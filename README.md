# THE-LOVE-OF-GOD
It is very true that God loves, because He is the one who created you and brought you on the earth through your parents. God knows your value, because there is an assignment that He brought you for it here on the earth; This is why Jesus Christ was crucified, died, and resurrected for you to be saved so as to accomplish God's will on the earth.
